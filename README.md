# Rubika Game Engine
The Rubika Game Engine is a HTML, CSS and JS game engine using Node.JS. There is also a Python version that is currently in development
It can currently only make 2D and Isometric games but will expand soon. 

Rubika Game Engine is currently not developed by Techvia Genix but is released under it's name. 
The name Rubika means Redistributed United Interchangeable Knowledge Advanced Game Engine. The name is inspired by the Rubik Cube as there is millions of diffrent stuff you can make.
Rubika uses the RPMS (Rubika Package Manager System) to install extentions. Currently it's not public as it's not very good. 
## Development and testing
If you plan to develop and/or test then we recommend the following tools:
#### NodeJS 16+
#### Astronaut (Currently in private beta)
#### Nodemon, AR4N (Private Beta) or PM2
#### Sublime Text, Atom, Visual Studio Code or any other text editor/IDE
#### Any modern browser or the latest ElectronJS version (for the Electron Version of Rubika Engine)
